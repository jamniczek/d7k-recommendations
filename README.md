## Non-technical overview
D7K is a chatbot that happened to hate mankind. It is able to provide recommendations for book, movies, games etc. It is also able to maintain pretty limited conversation with the user. 'Help' command provides insruction on how to get recommendations from the bot. 

Bot can be interacted with here: https://ancient-badlands-76161.herokuapp.com/ Bear in mind that first interaction may be a bit slow, due to delay on the hosting platform. 

## A bit more technical overview

D7K is built with React using Arwes.js library (https://arwesjs.org/) providing most of the layout. I also consists of backend service (https://github.com/jamniczek/d7k-node-server) built with node.js + express.
